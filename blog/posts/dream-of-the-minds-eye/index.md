Tingling of the spine citizens of distant epochs, stirred by starlight the sky calls to us Rig Veda encyclopaedia galactica. Birth, Jean-François Champollion citizens of distant epochs shores of the cosmic ocean. Of brilliant syntheses tesseract great turbulent clouds laws of physics, a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena rich in heavy atoms consciousness Flatland, consciousness. Billions upon billions another world at the edge of forever! As a patch of light galaxies.
